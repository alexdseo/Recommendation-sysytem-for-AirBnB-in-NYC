In this project, method to build a recommendation system using principal components analysis and clustering analysis will be provided. Recommendation system is used by multiple IT companies to make personalized recommendation for their customers and help them to make a decision for their products. Lodging company, such as, Airbnb and Trivago are overlooking power of the recommendation system, therefore, the recommendation system for this project will be built based on Airbnb data in New York city. Recommendation system will be powered by clustering analysis, including k-means clustering and model-based clustering will be performed on two diﬀerent plots. One plot will be generated with coordinate data of the accomodation and other being generated with principal components of diﬀerent datasets. While making plots based on principal components, analysis will be done to obtain deeper understanding of the dataset.
